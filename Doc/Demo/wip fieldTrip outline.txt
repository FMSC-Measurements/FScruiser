FScruiser, what has changed

 - new cruise file type , crz3
 	- fscruiser has the ability to convert older cruise file types, but this ability may be removed because it is recomended to have an end to end setup.
 - tally history replaced with with full tally history. history displays more that just tallies and samples it includes all changes to the tree count. 
 - count trees are nolonger being used to represent multiple non-measure trees. count trees in converted files will appear only as tree count edits in the tally feed
 - users adding or removing tree counts can select from predefined resons for the counts as well as add remarks. 
 - allow capturing both the device operator and the cruiser taking measurments. 
 - Plot creation unified. Add plot onece. If unit has multiple plot strata, user can select what strata 

 ## enhancments
 - cruiser can resolve warnings in the field. 
 - data is saved in smaller chunks, as close to when the user makes the change, rather than in larger sets.
