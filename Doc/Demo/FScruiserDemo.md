# FScruiser Demo

The purpose of demoing this unit is to show how the application will be used with a team of cruisers with one cruiser running the device and multiple cruisers calling out to the cruiser running the device. 

Although this demo can be done with one person, it may work better with participation from a volunteer from the audience 

## Cutting Unit 1 (Sample Tree and Three P)

Unit 1 contains 2 strata: a Sample Tree Stratum and Three P Strata
The sample tree stratum is set up with two sample groups: a hardwood sample group (OH) with two species 400 (hickory) and 375 (birch). 
the other is a hardwood pulp sample group (ZH) with a larger number of species and a 1 in 100 sampling frequency which is set up for clicker tally. 



| Stratum   | SampleGroup   | Species   | DBH   | Height|
|---        |----           |----       |----   |----   |
|01         |OH             |375        |11     |40     |

|01         |OH             |400        |13.3   |43     |
|01         |OH             |400        |17.6   |49     |
|01         |OH             |375        |14.4   |40     |
|01         |ZH             |318        |12.4   |45     |
|01         |OH             |400        |16.4   |37     |
|01         |ZH             |318        |7      |26     |


## Cutting Unit 2 FCM 

The design of the strata in this unit is pretty much the same as Unit 1 so the it uses the same measurement data


| Stratum   | SampleGroup   | Species   | DBH   | Height|
|---        |----           |----       |----   |----   |
|01         |OH             |375        |11     |40     |
|01         |OH             |400        |16.7   |54     |
|01         |OH             |400        |13.3   |43     |
|01         |OH             |400        |17.6   |49     |
|01         |OH             |375        |14.4   |40     |

|01         |OH             |400        |16.4   |37     |
|01         |ZH             |318        |7      |26     |


## Cutting Unit 3 FIX 

This unit has 1 FIX stratum with 3 sample groups. Each sample group has only one species. 
In this part of the demo we can demo the limiting distance calculator.
