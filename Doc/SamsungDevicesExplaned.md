# Samsung Device Models Explained
With Samsung being by far the leading maker of Android devices, it is likely that you may decide to purchase a Samsung device. However deciding which Samsung device to purchase can be a bit confusing. Unlike other device manufactures that will typically release only a few distinct models of devices a year, Samsung may release up to 20 different models in a year and has many different product lines that have changed naming schemes over the years. 

The purpose of this document is enplane the differences between the various product lines and help you understand the names of various models.

#Phones
Note: there are several lines not listed below as well as models not part of any of the main lines. Only devices that are widely available in the U.S. are listed. 

##S 
The S line standing for "Super Smart", is Samsung's high-end line of smart phones, featuring top of the line hardware and most memory.

Along with the standard S model Samsung also has multiple variants of the S model. There are a few variants not listed below and a S line for tablets, which I will talk about separately when I discuss tablets. Also it is worth noting the S line moved from using roman numerals to numbers starting with the S4.

The S4 can be updated to Android 5.0.1
The S5 can be updated to Android 6.0.1

### Active
The Active variant offers a water, dust and shock resistant version of the S line and is available for the S6, S7, S8 phones. There is also a Active line for tablets.

###Sport 
Similar to the Active variant this version adds water and shock resistance, but is marketed towards people looking to use their phones while working out. 

### Plus/+ 
These are slightly larger versions. Typically adding around .5in in display size from the standard version.

### Edge
More of a novelty version. These phones have a screen that slightly curves around the edge of the screen so that part of the screen can be seen can be seen when the device is face down a desk. 


#A
A mid to high-mid level line of phones and tablets. The first generation starting in late 2014. Each generation having multiple tiers typicaly ranging from A3 to A10 but later generations have moved to using double digits ranging from A10 to A80. **Not to be confused** with the version scheme used with the S line, the number after the A does not indicate what year the device was released, rather, it more indicates the relative capabilities of the phone for the year it was released.

#J 
A discontinued line of low-mid range phones targeted. This line spans from 2015 to 2018. Like the A series, the J series is comprised of multiple tiers ranging from J1 to the J7, where a phone with a higher number after the J does not necessarily mean that phone has newer hardware or a newer version of Android. 

For more information and specifications about the J line refer to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_J_series).

##Note
Between phones and tablets, the note line pushes the upper limits of the size range for smart phones. The screen sizes range from around 5.5in to 6.5in in newer models. These devices also come with a pen which is where the name "note" comes from. The pen can be inserted into the device when not being used. Also the pen uses a electro magnetic field rather than touch to work.   

From 2012 to to 2014 Samsung also release several Tablets under the name of Note. Unlike the phone line, the number in the tablet model name refers to the screen size **not** when the model was released. The Galaxy Note 8.0 is a tablet with a 8 inch screen, not to be confused with the Note 8 which is a phone. 

#Tablets
There are many different models of Samsung tablet with naming conventions that have changed over the years. The S and A lines match up with the naming in the phones where S indicates that it is a higher end model and A is more budget oriented. Most models come with multiple screen size options denoted by a number with a decimal in their model name indicating the screen size.
