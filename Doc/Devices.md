## Screen 
FScruiser has been designed to work on both phone and tablet screens sizes. However we find that devices on the larger size for phones or the smaller size for tablets are the best fit for most people. Medium sized devices (6 - 8 inches) seem to offer a good compromise between the amount of information they can display, being easy to hold and easy to quickly store away when not in use.

## Other Features
### Active Pen
Some devices Samsung devices come with a pen. Known as the S Pen, these pens work different from how other third "pens". Also known as an active pen, these pens interact with the device without using touch. When the S pen is used FScruiser is able to differentiate between touch and the pen, allowing you to enable a pen only mode.
